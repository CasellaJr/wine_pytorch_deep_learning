# wine_pytorch_deep_learning

Jupyter Notebook for the Exam of the Neural Computing course at UniCT

## Description

In this notebook, I present a case study for modeling wine quality based on a dataset related to the red variant of the Portuguese “Vinho Verde” wine.
The report is organized as follows: the first chapter describes the dataset; 
in the second chapter, I discuss Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) including data processing, missing values, correlation plots, outliers and so on; 
the third chapter presents Deep Learning experiments and conclusions.
